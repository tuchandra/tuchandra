## Hi. I'm Tushar.
I'm a **senior software engineer** working on shipping new ML algorithms for personalized medicine at [Tempus](https://www.tempus.com/).

Previously, I was a **senior data scientist** at [Nielsen Global Media](https://nielsen.com), where I researched Bayesian inference models for TV viewing and digital measurement. I graduated from Northwestern (go 'cats!). I did my undergrad in Computer Science & [Integrated Science](https://isp.northwestern.edu/), and a master's in CS.
