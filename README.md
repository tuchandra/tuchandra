## Hi. I'm Tushar.
I'm an engineer at [Loop](https://loop.com/).

Previously, I was an engineer at [Tempus AI](https://tempus.com) working on precision medicine for cancer patients; and before that, a data scientist at [Nielsen Global Media](https://nielsen.com), where I researched Bayesian inference models for TV viewing and digital measurement. I graduated from Northwestern (go 'cats!). I did my undergrad in Computer Science & [Integrated Science](https://isp.northwestern.edu/), and a master's in CS.
