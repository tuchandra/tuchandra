## Hi. I'm Tushar.
I'm a **software engineer** working on shipping new ML algorithms for personalized medicine. I also keep up with research in HCI and social computing; see my website **[tusharc.dev](https://tusharc.dev)** for regular summaries of things I've read. 

Previously, I was a **senior data scientist** at [Nielsen Global Media](https://nielsen.com), where I researched Bayesian inference models for TV viewing and digital measurement. I graduated from Northwestern (go 'cats!). I did my undergrad in Computer Science & [Integrated Science](https://isp.northwestern.edu/), and a master's in CS.
